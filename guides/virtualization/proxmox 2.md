[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) is a free ([community paid tier for support](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-mail-gateway/pricing)) hypervisor. While Proxmox is not an officially supported Packet OS, this guide will help you get it up and running.

#### Provision a Server With Debian 10
For this demostration, we'll use our c1.small configuration running Debian 10.

From the **Optional Settings**, click switch to enable ' **Configure IPs**' to create a custom subnet-size of /28.

Once device is deployed, please make sure that your machines hostname is resovable via `/etc/hosts`, i.e you need an entry in `/etc/hosts` which includes your v4 address to the FQDN of your device.

**Note:** Make sure there is no reference to IPv6 address for your hostname specificed in `/etc/hosts`

For example, if your IP address is 139.178.67.13, and your hostname is prox.domain.com, then in your `/etc/hosts` file should look like:

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
139.178.67.130  prox.domain.com prox
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1	ip6-allnodes
ff02::2	ip6-allrouters
````
You can then test if your hostname/IP are correct using the `hostname` command:
```
hostname --ip-address
139.178.67.130
```

#### Install Proxmox Repo
Add the repository to your apt list:
````
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list
````
Add the Proxmox repository key:
````
wget http://download.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-ve-release-6.x.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-ve-release-6.x.gpg
````
Update your repository and system by running:
````
apt update && apt full-upgrade
````
#### Install Proxmox Packages
````
apt install proxmox-ve postfix open-iscsi
````
Watch terminal/console screen to configure packages which require input (e.g. Samba asking about WINS/DHCP support, and email server). If you do not have or need a mail server keep it local only and keep the system name as is.

Lastly, reboot the system, the new Proxmox kernel should automatically boot from the GRUB menu.

**NOTE:** If you have a subscription key don't forget to switch to the enterprise repository after installation, see [Package repositories](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_Repositories).


#### Connect to the Proxmox Interface
COnnect to the intercia via https://youripaddress:8006). The default username will be `root` and the password listed in the portal or if you have changed it, it would be that. Should you not recall the root password, [reset directions(found here)]

Once logged in, create a Linux Bridge called vmbr0, and add your first network interface to it. In this example it would be `bond0`. In short, move the IP addresses from bond0 to vmbr0s of `bond0` to vmbr0.

For these interface changes to take effect, you would need to restart the system. You can do this via command line with `shutdown -r now` or via the web interface on either Proxmox or customer portal.
