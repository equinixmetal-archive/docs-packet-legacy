OpenNebula miniONE as a simple evaluation tool that allows you to deploy all-in-one installation for KVM or LXD deployments in a few simple steps. One of the various options enables you to build an OpenNebula edge cloud using bare-metal cloud resources from Packet. With this architecture, you will be able to see just how simple it is to build your private cloud and to deploy and configure Packet resources on-demand. 

#### Frontend

You will need one host for the OpenNebula frontend. It could be a physical host in your rack, your own VM or even a host running in the public cloud. Choose either the Centos/Redhat or Ubuntu/Debian family, just ensure it is a relatively fresh and updated system.


For this demo, we decided to also run the frontend on the small Packet host, so let’s start at Packet. For the operating system it could be Ubuntu 19.04. You can even choose fairly priced t1.small server, OpenNebula is not greedy.

As soon as your server is ready, connect to it and download the tool

```
# wget 'https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione/releases/latest/download/minione'
```

To start the edge deployment you will need to both the project ID and API Token.

Choose the location for your Edge deployment. For this example, we are using Sunnyvale, CA for which the code name is `sjc1`. 


Finally choose the device type. Suggestion is to keep using the `t1.small` as the default. To opt for an alternate type, provide it using the `--edge-packet-plan` parameter. 

#### Time for deployment

```
# bash minione --edge packet --edge-packet-facility sjc1 --edge-packet-token [API_TOKEN] --edge-packet-project [project UUID]
````

> **_NOTE:_** You may see error: "Check jq installed FAILED. Install jq package first

miniONE would like to validate all the Packet parameters and to parse the json output `jq` command is needed. In our case we will install it using: 

````
apt update && apt install jq
````

Re-run the deployment. While miniONE is running, you should receive a siilar output

```

### Report
OpenNebula 5.8 was installed
Sunstone [the webui] is running on:
  http://147.75.84.191/
Use following to login:
  user: oneadmin
  password: xDV36pWwGe
 
### Packet provisioned
  ID NAME            CLUSTER   TVM      ALLOCATED_CPU      ALLOCATED_MEM STAT
   0 147.75.82.249   PacketClu   0                  -                  - init
````
After a few moments, penNebula monitors the Packet host and you can see it on. Check using `onehost list` you will see a similar output: 

````
# onehost list
  ID NAME            CLUSTER   TVM      ALLOCATED_CPU      ALLOCATED_MEM STAT  
   0 147.75.82.249   PacketClu   0       0 / 400 (0%)     0K / 7.8G (0%) on
````


#### Run the VM

At this point, you have a ready-to-use OpenNebula frontend connected with the KVM hypervisor on the Packet and you are ready to deploy your VMs. You can do it using the Sunstone frontend or just by typing

````
# onetemplate instantiate 0
````
For demo purposes, the default appliance is the WordPress service app. When the first VM is running, browse to the public IP of the VM and you will see the a bootstrapped Wordpress page. of the VM and you should get a bootstrapped WordPress page.

![miniONE](/images/minione/wordpress.png)

To obtain the VM public IP you would run: 

````
onevm show 0 | grep ETH0_ALIAS0_IP
````
and see the following output: 
````
ETH0_ALIAS0_IP="147.75.82.242",
````

miniONE gives you an option to extend the deployment by adding additional hypervisor nodes at the edge. To do so simply add an option `--node` to the deployment command and run it again. For this demo we opted for `ams1` facility-code. 

You may choose a different appliance for your particular use case. Go to the [Open Nebula marketplace](https://marketplace.opennebula.systems/appliance) and pick one of the systems. 

> **_NOTE:_**  Exact name is a requirement to the parameter `--edge-marketapp-name`. For instance `CentOS 7 - KVM` is a valid option.

````
# ./minione --edge packet --node --edge-packet-token [token] --edge-packet-project [project] --edge-packet-facility ams1
````

When the deployment completes, you should then see two hosts. 

````
# onehost list
  ID NAME            CLUSTER   TVM      ALLOCATED_CPU      ALLOCATED_MEM STAT  
   1 147.75.82.195   PacketClu   0       0 / 400 (0%)     0K / 7.8G (0%) on    
   0 147.75.82.249   PacketClu   1    100 / 800 (12%)   768M / 7.8G (9%) on
````

Under the hood, miniONE uses the [DDC](http://docs.opennebula.org/5.8/advanced_components/ddc/) tool called [oneprovision[(http://docs.opennebula.org/5.8/advanced_components/ddc/usage.html)], which also offers a command-line interface. To list the Packet resources, type: 

````
# oneprovision list
                                  ID NAME                      CLUSTERS HOSTS VNETS DATASTORES STAT

#### Pricing and cleanup

Before you finish the evaluation, don’t forget to cleanup. To delete the Packet nodes you can use again the oneprovision command. Then also delete the frontend from the Packet.

If you choose the t1.small server for the frontend and nodes as we did, the final price could hardly exceed $1 as the hourly price for the server is $0.07.

````
# oneprovision delete [id] --cleanup
````
