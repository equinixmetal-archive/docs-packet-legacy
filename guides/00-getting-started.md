### Welcome to Packet’s Technical Guides section!

The purpose of this section is to provide you with interesting, up-to-date and effective guides to help you get the most out of our platform.

Unlike our Product Docs and related resources (API docs and integration docs) this section involves use cases that move beyond the basics, outlines solutions to specific problems (or opportunities!), and leverage external tools and software.

See an area where we can improve? Want to write a guide? Submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/packethost/docs/issues/new) or contact us on [support](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/support/getting-started/), and we’ll see how to get it done.
