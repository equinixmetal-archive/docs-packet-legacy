Packet's c1.xlarge.x86 server configuration includes 2 x 800GB NVMe drives, which are PCI-e attached flash cards.

With this new drive type, some of your common Linux disk utilities may have trouble recognizing the cards. Specifically, fdisk has limitations around GPT and doesn't show the latest NVMe drives. As such, Packet recommends using GNU parted to partition the NVMe drives.

We have provided some example commands below to get you started using these awesome, high-performance flash cards. The drives should show up as nvme0n1 and nvme1n1.

Example: Create a Single Large EXT4 Partition with GPT Label on nvme0n1

```
~# lsblk

```

Use parted  to create a new GPT partition table on the first disk.

root@ub14-test1:~# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt
Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/nvme0n1 will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue? Yes/No? Yes
Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.

Now create a new ext4 partition,

```
~# parted -a optimal /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.
root@ub14-test1:~# parted /dev/nvme0n1
GNU Parted 2.3

~# mount | grep nvme

```

I order to make the new volume persistent you will need to update `/etc/fstab`  with the drives UUID. Running cat on fstab will inform you the blkid command can be used to get a list of UUIDs for your devices.

```
~# blkid
/dev/nvme0n1: PTUUID="316bf358-35ff-4e6f-ae87-9a4fcb5e68b3" PTTYPE="gpt"
/dev/nvme0n1p1: UUID="04462c9d-a04d-4ced-9e20-6b02c212563b" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="primary"
```

Once you have the correct UUID, use `nano` to add it to your `fstab` file.
