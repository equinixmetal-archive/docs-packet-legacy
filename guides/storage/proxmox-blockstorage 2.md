Now that you have successfully converted Debian 10 to Proxmox, this guide will assist you in adding additional storage space. Having this storage will assist in HA & live migrations, should you have a cluster setup.


#### Creating & Attaching Storage Volume

If you have not yet created a volume, and attached the volume to your device. Please review our guide on [Elastic Block Storage guide]()

#### Adding Storage through Proxmox UI

Adding the stroage volume to Proxmox is done through going to Datacenter → Storage → iSCSI:

Continue the process on the popup window requesting information about the volume you are attaching:

* ID: the name for your storage mount point
Portal: the IQN which is the 10.x IP address from the `packet-block-storage-attach` command you previously ran.

* Target: once a valid 10.x IP address is adjusted you should see see a target in which you can select.

Upon completion your storage volume appears on the top under the primary storage screen

To utilize the newly added block storage volume, you must create another storage mount point, this time LVM.

The next screen prompts you for items required to complete this storage LVM.
ID: a name you wish to call your this volume, it will contain the virtual machine disks & container images.

* Base Storage: is the iSCSI you previously added
* Base Volume: is as shown, and the only option
* Volume Group: a name in which you want to call the storage group.
* Content: You can have one or both, VM disk images / container images.

You should now see both the iSCSI and LVM listed under storage

Bravo! You now have a working block storage volume to expand your existing space for your containers / virtual machines.
