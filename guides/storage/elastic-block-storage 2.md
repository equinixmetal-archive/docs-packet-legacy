### Elastic Block Storage

To create a new volume, click on the 'Deploy Storage Volume' button.  On the following screen, give the volume a description, choose the size of the volume in GB, and select the location, then performance tier.

A snapshot is a differential copy of your volume made at a specific moment in time. If you have a 500GB volume, but only 250 GB of data on it, your snapshot is only 250 GB. With a snapshots, you are only billed for the changes to the original block device from the time the snapshot is made — as such, a policy of 5 snapshots may end up being only a small amount of storage if your rate of change on the device is low. Billing for all snapshots is at our lower $0.07/GB per month tier.

### Performance Tiers

When you need persistent storage, with built-in replication and snapshots, our block storage product is a very useful tool.  We offer two performance tiers:

* **Standard Tier:**  ($0.000104/GB per hour) - With 500 IOPS per volume this is good for backups, dev/test, and medium use datasets.

* **Premium Tier:** ($0.000223/GB per hour) - With 15,000 IOPS per volume this is targeted at higher I/O heavy workloads.



### Attach / Detach the Volume to the Server

After your volume is created, you need to route it to the server you would like to mount it on.  To do so, go to the server detail page that you'd like to connect the block device to and click on the Storage submenu on the left.  Select your volume from the drop-down box and click 'Attach'.  This routes the volume to your block device and allows you to mount it from your local server via iSCSI.


Once attached to your server, you will see the volume name, size & where it is located:

### Attach / Detach Scripts

As Packet does not have an agent running on any client-server or remote access to client machines, you need to run the final attach of the iSCSI volume to your server on your own.  Packet provides a block storage management script to make this process easy.  You can access the attach (detach as well) script via Github [here](https://github.com/packethost/packet-block-storage).

In order to complete the attachment process, you will need to run the following on the device's CLI:

⚠️ **ARM users:** Please note, the scripts are built with x86 in mind, and do not currently include JQ for aarch64.  As such, you will need to first manually install jq as follows:

 `apt-get install jq`

All other users:

```
root@block:~# packet-block-storage-attach -m queue

portal: 10.144.35.179 iqn: iqn.2013-05.com.daterainc:tc:01:sn:5d9defb6cbc43192

portal: 10.144.51.225 iqn: iqn.2013-05.com.daterainc:tc:01:sn:5d9defb6cbc43192

create: volume-32829074 (36001405d589377db1a14b08913f04a14) undef DATERA,IBLOCK

size=1000G features='1 queue_if_no_path' hwhandler='1 alua' wp=undef

`-+- policy='round-robin 0' prio=1 status=undef

 |- 10:0:0:0 sdc 8:32 undef ready running

 `- 11:0:0:0 sdd 8:48 undef ready running

Block device /dev/mapper/volume-32829074 is available for use
```


The option `-m queue` is very important, if block storage becomes inaccessible, this directive will keep the IO in-memory buffer until it becomes accessible.


### Creating the partition with gdisk

After mounting the block device, you need to partition the block device.  You can do so using gdisk, as follows (replace the volume_name_here with the volume label outputted by the attach script above):

```
root@block:~# gdisk /dev/mapper/{volume_name_here}
```


You can use the default settings or adjust according to your particular use-case.   After partitioning the disk you can verify the volume partition was successfully created as follows:

```
root@block:~# ls -al /dev/mapper/

crw------- 1 root root 10, 236 Nov  8 17:55 /dev/mapper/control

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       7 Nov  8 17:59 /dev/mapper/volume-32829074 -> ../dm-0

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       7 Nov  8 17:59 /dev/mapper/volume-32829074-part1 -> ../dm-1
```

If the new partition is not showing, please run:

`kpartx -u /dev/mapper/volume-xxxxxx and verify again with ls -al /dev/mapper/* `

### Create a filesystem on the volume

Now that you've set up the partition, you must format the partition with a filesystem.  For this example, we will make use of ext4 although you are welcome to choose whatever filesystem you'd like:

```
root@block:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/volume-32829074-part1

mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)

Creating filesystem with 262143739 4k blocks and 65536000 inodes

Superblock backups stored on blocks:

4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872, 71663616, 78675968,

102400000, 214990848

Allocating group tables: done

Writing inode tables: done

Creating journal (32768 blocks): done

Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```


### Mount the partition

Finally, we're ready to mount the formatted partition.  To do so, issue:

`root@block:~# mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/volume-6a18e249-part1 /mnt/`


If you run `fdisk -l`  the new storage will be displayed

```

```

### Remount storage should your device be rebooted

In order for the device to mount on boot, we need to add an entry to fstab.  Instead of using the volume name (e.g. /dev/mapper/volume-xxx name ), we need to grab the UUID of the volume device, as follows:

```root@block:~# blkid | grep volume-32829074-part1

/dev/mapper/volume-32829074-part1: UUID="20e0931a-255b-4bf7-8e22-5da91198279f" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="Linux filesystem" PARTUUID="0f9151b7-d2a3-45e4-97ed-ba2c7462ed4b"
```

As you can see from the output above, the UUID in this case is `20e0931a-255b-4bf7-8e22-5da91198279f`.  You would then proceed to add an entry to the fstab in /etc/fstab, as follows:

```
echo 'UUID=20e0931a-255b-4bf7-8e22-5da91198279f /mnt ext4 _netdev 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab

```

⚠️  **Debian Users:** A known issue when utilizing the UUID & rebooting the device will cause the multipath connection to fail. Instead of UUID please use the volume name in fstab:

`/dev/mapper/volume-13a7e577-part1 /storage ext4 _netdev 0 0 `


  ### Detach / Delete Storage Volume

If you want to detach and delete a storage volume, or simply move it to a new server you should:

Detach it via cli:

```
root@Ubuntu-block-storage:~# umount /dev/mapper/volume-xxxxx-part1
```
Once the unmount is confirmed, run the block storage detach script packet-block-storage-detach
Then, detach the device from the server in the portal: Device View > Storage > Manage > Detach
Optionally, delete the block device from portal: Project View > Storage > Options > Delete


### Tips & Tricks

Our Block Storage service looks and smells a lot like Amazon’s EBS.  One important difference is that when you connect a block storage volume on Packet to a server on Packet, you don’t have the benefit of a hypervisor layer.  As such, there is a bit more you should know about how to troubleshoot or deal with any issues that may arise.

While our Block Storage product is the perfect match for a wide variety of use cases, the first and most important step is to understand when *not* to use block storage at Packet.   

As a general rule of thumb, databases are not a good fit for our Block Storage, especially those that are not resilient due to minor hiccups.  While uncommon, even a small loss of connectivity to some databases can cause major issues.  

### Redundancy

Each installation of our Block Storage product is made up of three physical servers, each with redundant network and power.  In order to support data redundancy, each volume you create is replicated twice on the storage cluster.

The following commands will show more information about these paths:

```
root@block-storage:~# iscsiadm -m session


tcp: [1] 10.144.50.243:3260,1 iqn.2013-05.com.daterainc:tc:01:sn:e5ac2dc1d7335491 (non-flash)

tcp: [2] 10.144.34.62:3260,1 iqn.2013-05.com.daterainc:tc:01:sn:e5ac2dc1d7335491 (non-flash)
```

From this output, you can see the two iSCSI target IPs.  If you are able to ping them fine, that means there is good network connectivity to the volume. Next, we recommend that you check DM-multipath with the following  command:

```
root@block-storage:~# multipath -ll

volume-9674e518 (360014057ee4d5efb13a4c33a24ba765f) dm-0 DATERA,IBLOCK

size=200G features='1 queue_if_no_path' hwhandler='1 alua' wp=rw

`-+- policy='round-robin 0' prio=1 status=active

|- 9:0:0:0 sdc 8:32 active ready running

`- 8:0:0:0 sdd 8:48 active ready running
```

### Resiliency

Using the -m queue option when attaching a volume is recommended since, during instances of very brief network blips, the server will keep IO in a memory buffer until the volume is reachable again.   This greatly enhances resiliency and will prevent the volume from going into read-only mode.

Although we do our best to prevent downtime, it would be a lie to say that network attached anything will have a 100% uptime, forever. There will be cases when a volume will go into read-only mode, such as if there is a longer network interruption, or there are issues with the storage cluster itself (volumes go read-only in order to protect any information that is there against possible corruption).

The best way to bring a volume back in this scenario is to detach it with the following command (you can specify which volume to detach by optionally adding the volume's ID)

`packet-block-storage-detach {volume-id}`


After a few seconds, reattach the volume with:

`packet-block-storage-attach -v -m queue {volume-id}`

The Verbose option will show any possible issues during the attach process. If the attach command is not successful, or if it shows any problems, please contact us.

### Extending Storage Volume

You can also [extend/grow](https://www.packet.com/resources/guides/extending-blockstorage) your block storage volume after it's been deployed.
