# BGP Global Communities

## Default Behavior

The default behavior (no community) for customer prefixes is that they are advertised to all providers and peers within the facility the prefix is received in.

## Global Anycast BGP
If you're using an IP range across multiple regions you can use Packet's Anycast community:

**54825:222**

-   Function: Anycast routing
-   By tagging your routes with this community, Packet will advertise your routes to only transit and peering we maintain consistently on a global basis. Regional ISPs we connect with (e.g. Verizon in the New York metro area) will not learn your routes, as advertising to them may result in "scenic" routing for you with global Anycast configurations.
-   Please note that this community should only be used for global Anycast deployments and is not advised for use in a single datacenter, as it will limit the number of available paths/providers you have access to. It should only be deployed by you seeking BGP Anycast topology, with multiple server instances deployed in each Packet datacenter.


## Advanced BGP 

You can fine tune reachability to the IPs you announce by attaching Traffic Engineering (TE) Communities.

The purpose of TE Communities is to tell the Packet network which providers and peers to advertise your prefixes to, allowing for more granular control than default (sans-community) BGP or the Global Anycast BGP community referened above (54825:222).

Using any of the communities listed below gives you full control over the oubound advertisment of your prefixes. You are able to advertise to any combination of providers and peers that exist within a location. Each provider has its own set of communities. If a provider's community is not included on a prefix, we will not advertise it to that provider.  


### Combining Communities 

You are able to combine communities for granular control of your announcements. For example, you can use a combination of communities to advertise to Telia and Zayo, but not Limelight. Or you could advertise to Telia, prepend three times to Zayo, and advertise to an Internet Exchange (IX).

  
### Usage Guidelines

To use the communities correctly please follow the guide below:

-   Other communities such as 54825:222 and 54825:223 should be removed
    
-   To advertise a prefix to any provider, the “Advertise to XXX” must be used. E.g. to advertise to Telia, 54825:500 must be used. If only a single provider community is used, the prefix will only be advertised to that provider.
    
-   Combine communities to advertise to multiple providers, e.g. Use 54825:500 & 54825:510 to advertise to both Telia and Zayo
    
-   To prepend you must include the “Advertise to XXX” community as well as the prepend community. E.g to prepend two times to Limelight, you must use 54825:530 & 54825:532. This tells our routers to advertise to Limelight, and prepend twice.
