Multicast (often referred to as multicasting) is where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously.  Multicast can be a one-to-many or a many-to-many distribution.  Multicast requires the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers.  

### Why is Multicasting disabled on Packet's network?
Packet does not support multi-cast in its default Layer 3 network topology. This is due to performance and security concerns around multi-tenant switch and router scaling issues.

To do this, we suggest leveraging a GRE tunnel.

### What is GRE?
Generic Routing Encapsulation (or GRE for short), is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network.

### How to setup a GRE tunnel between two devices
Setting a GRE tunnel between devices is pretty straight forward. The following is a basic configuration for CentOS devices.

**Device 1:**
```
DEVICE=gre1
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=GRE
PEER_OUTER_IPADDR=Site2.public.address
PEER_INNER_IPADDR=Site2.private.address
MY_INNER_IPADDR=Site1.private.address
```

**Device 2:**
```
DEVICE=gre1
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=GRE
PEER_OUTER_IPADDR=Site1.public.address
PEER_INNER_IPADDR=Site1.private.address
MY_INNER_IPADDR=Site2.private.address
```

On both devices, bring the interface up by running ifup gre1

To verify configuration, you can run ifconfig gre and sample the output here, on **device 1:***
```
[root@centos-ewr1 ~]# ifconfig gre1
gre1: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1476
        inet 10.100.126.3  netmask 255.255.255.255  destination 10.88.152.3
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-F0-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 0  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

[root@centos-ewr1 ~]#
```

The same ran on **device 2:**
```
[root@centos-sjc1 ~]# ifconfig gre1
gre1: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1476
        inet 10.88.152.3  netmask 255.255.255.255  destination 10.100.126.3
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-F0-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 0  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

[root@centos-sjc1 ~]#
```

Ping Device 2 <> Device 1
```
[root@centos-sjc1 ~]# ping -c5 10.100.126.3

With a quick TCPDump--`tcpdump -n -i bond0 proto 47`--on bond0 you can verify that traffic between the two devices is flowing through the GRE tunnel
```
17:36:22.295418 IP 147.75.64.13 > 147.75.69.141: GREv0, length 56: IP 10.100.126.3.48950 > 10.88.152.3.ssh: Flags [.], ack 2897, win 249, options [nop,nop,TS val 2332411 ecr 6130351], length 0

17:36:25.360737 IP 147.75.64.13 > 147.75.69.141: GREv0, length 124: IP 10.100.126.3.48950 > 10.88.152.3.ssh: Flags [P.], seq
1764:1832, ack 2897, win 249, options [nop,nop,TS val 2335476 ecr 6130351], length 68

17:36:25.360917 IP 147.75.69.141 > 147.75.64.13: GREv0, length 124: IP 10.88.152.3.ssh > 10.100.126.3.48950: Flags [P.], seq
2897:2965, ack 1832, win 149, options [nop,nop,TS val 6133490 ecr 2335476], length 68
```

Note: the above method sends traffic in plain text. To encrypt traffic it would be wise to setup IPSec, Wireguard, etc.

### Enabling Multicast
To ensure gre1 has multicast enabled in the event of a reboot please check  /usr/sbin/ifup-pre-local and make sure it looks like this example:
```
#!/bin/bash
set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail -o xtrace
iface=${1#*-}
case $iface in
  bond0 | enp0s20f0) ip link set $iface address 0c:c4:7a:81:0a:84;;
          enp0s20f1) ip link set $iface address 0c:c4:7a:81:0a:85 && sleep 4;;
               gre1) ip link set $iface multicast on;;
                  *) echo "ignoring unknown interface $iface" && exit 0;;
esac
```
️ It should be noted, the interface named gre1 can of course be renamed to something that matches your deployment & configuration.
