There are a few ways to deploy devices on Packet.

**[Hourly On Demand](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/deployment-options/on-demand/):** These servers are our most popular & can be via the customer portal, API, API integration, or Terraform script. All server types found on [our webpage](https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/) are eligible for On-Demand deployment--availability permitting. Available inventory is not guaranteed for On-Demand instance provisioning requests, see our documentation on [capacity](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/deployment-options/capacity/) for more information about availability.

**[Reserved Hardware](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/deployment-options/reserved-hardware/):** Provides the ability to reserve specific servers for a committed period of time. Unlike hourly on-demand, once you reserve hardware, you will have access to that specific hardware for the duration of the reservation. For additional information, it is suggested to reach out to your specific account manager.

**[Spot Market](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/getting-started/deployment-options/spot-market/):** Spot market is a marketplace with constantly changing inventory. You can place bids on this inventory by defining a variety of factors such as the maximum price you are willing to pay for a particular resource.
