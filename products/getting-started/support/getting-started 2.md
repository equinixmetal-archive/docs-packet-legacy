All Packet support channels are available from the [customer portal](https://app.packet.net/support). From there you can open a ticket, send us an email, open our community slack, @ us on twitter, or open a chat with our support engineers. You can also log into the [support portal](https://support.packet.com), where you can track the status of your open tickets.

**Tickets VS Chat:** Most minor issues can be resolved over chat. However, it's best to submit a ticket if you encounter a problem with some faulty packet hardware, find a bug in a packet service, or have any other issue that might require long term investigation. Our support agents can do this for you if you discover you're problem is more extensive than it initially appeared while you are in chat. Please be aware that we cannot make changes to an account that were requested over chat. That includes adjustments to entitlements, account reviews, hardware reservations, or IP allocations. These, and similar request, must be made via a ticket.


**Email:** If you do not wish to log into the support portal, you are welcome to emailing support@packet.com. This will automatically open a ticket for you. Also, all replies to any of your open tickets will be emailed to you directly.


**Phone Calls:** We don't operate a phone support service. This is because it's generally much easier for us to assist you when we have information written down that can easily be shared with other members of our support team, or our other engineers, if necessary. However, if you would like support while working through a complex issue we are available for schedules virtual meetings or calls.


**Slack:** Our [community slack](https://slack.packet.com) is a good resource for support our agents may not be able to provide. This includes questions or problems regarding third party software and services. Packet's services are not managed, so any questions not related to Packet hardware or services would best be addressed to the community slack.
