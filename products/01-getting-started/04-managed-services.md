Unlike most public cloud providers, Packet does not provide a catalog of managed solutions like databases, load balancers, serverless functions or managed Kubernetes (see [this blog](http://staging.packet.net/blog/oops-we-forgot-to-build-a-managed-kubernetes-service/) post for details). 

The reason is simple: we focus on infrastructure and turn to an ecosystem of partners to provide best-of-breed solutions on top. This allows for a wide variety of solutions to tackle managed Kubernetes, databases-as-service, or DNS â€” and as a bonus you can take these same solutions to other cloud providers or to hybrid/private environments.
