Packet is super focused on automating hardware.  Since we have a global bare metal cloud, customers often want to know how we compare to other cloud providers.  

The simple answer is: we offer bare metal and other fundamental services (e.g. network) and don’t go “up the stack” into the application or managed services layers. Unlike most public cloud providers, we also provide a model by which you can deploy custom infrastructure, custom location, or even manage on-premises hardware. 

If you’re interested in seeing how we stack up against various providers, we have some [straight-talking comparison pages on our website](https://www.packet.com/about/compare/). We’re also happy to discuss in real time.
