With User State, you can programmatically inform the Packet API when userland operations have started, completed, or failed.  You can also view & query that information during deployment or later for better visibility into the process.  

* __Question:__ What's userland?
* __Answer:__ Anything running in the host OS after install.

### Background - When Active Doesn't Mean Active
Usually when our system reports that a server is "Active" it means that a provision has finished and you can ping/ssh into that server.  However, this isn't always the case with Custom iPXE installs or when you install a customized version of one of our base images (details).

When the provisioning system detects any of these two custom installation types, it will set the provision as "Active" very early in the process - basically once we are done with our part and begin installing the provided image.  

However, this "Active" state can be a bit misleading, as there is usually work still ongoing (such as installing your custom image!). This is where you can leverage custom "user state" events to gain better control over the process.

### Custom User State Events for Managing User Data
Another way to use this feature is when you leverage a lot of user-data during a normal installation. This can get bulky, and long running user-data leaves you a bit in the dark as to the state of your provision.

With our User State feature, you can see when the user-data install actually begins, and when it finishes.  

### How to Create a Custom User State Event
We support passing specific user state events to our API, but this has to happen from within the server instance itself.    

* Get the User State Url: First, from a device, get the User State Url by querying our metadata service for the user_state_url. This will slightly differ based on facility location, for this example the server is located in EWR1.  (hint: you might want to install and use jq in order to help automate this).  

```
curl https://metadata.packet.net/metadata | jq -r .user_state_url
```
Returns the User State events url:
```
http://tinkerbell.ewr1.packet.net/events
```

* Post a Custom User State event: If you want to send a custom user state event, you should send a POST request to the user state endpoint you retrieved earlier. This will add an event to the device's timeline and also display a message in the portal timeline section.  
```
curl -X POST -d '{"state":"running","code":1007,"message":"Im still provisioning!!!"}' http://tinkerbell.ewr1.packet.net/events
```
This allows you to see the custom user state event on the device timeline and device detail page:

* Indicate Success: You'll want to finish things off by communicating a successful install, changing the state to succeeded and maybe adding a cool message there.  
```
curl -X POST -d '{"state":"succeeded","code":1099,"message":"Im ready now!!!"}' http://tinkerbell.ewr1.packet.net/events
```

### Available Options
The POST request can accept the following data options:

* state (`running`, `succeeded`, or `failed`)
* code (anything between `1000` and `1099`, inclusive)
* message (can be any `string` you want!)


### Useful script

The following is a BASH script that you can use to easily send user-state events either in your custom-image installation process or user-data stages.

```
#!/bin/bash
url="$(curl https://metadata.packet.net/metadata | jq -r .user_state_url)"

send_user_state_event() {
          data=$(
          echo "{}" \
              | jq '.state = $state | .code = ($code | tonumber) | .message = $message' \
               --arg state "$1" \
               --arg code "$2" \
               --arg message "$3"
          )
          curl -v -X POST -d "$data" "$url"
}

send_user_state_event running 1000 "hey im still running"
send_user_state_event succeeded 1001 "hey im done now :)"
```
