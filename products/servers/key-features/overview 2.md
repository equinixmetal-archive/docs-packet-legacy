Deploying servers at Packet is very similar to working with compute instances at AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean and others. 

For example, we have full support for User Data, which can be used to perform various automation tasks after the server is ready (e.g. executing common scripts / packages or triggering other more advanced configuration processes).

However, since Packet is 100% focused on physical bare metal servers, there are some differences. This is especially true around workload portability, networking setup, and optimization.  

We've highlighted key features in this section that will be useful as you get comfortable deploying servers at Packet. For in-depth guides on particular use cases, we also have a growing [Technical Guides](https://www.packet.com/resources/guides/) section.
