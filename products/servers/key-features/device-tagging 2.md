Tagging is a feature allowing you to apply custom labels to a single device or multiple devices. Device tagging is purely for filtering purposes at this time. 

Tagging is avaible through our customer portal & API. To create, edit, and remove tags via the portal you will go to the device view page and then click on tags.

If you work directly with the API. An example of what payload may look like. This ayload would create a device in `EWR1` with CentOS as the OS and also tag it with `my_tag`, and `my_tag_2`. It will also lock the device to avoid it from being deleted. 

````
{ "plan: "baremetal_1".
"operating_system:" "centos",
"facility": "ewr1",
"tags": ["my_tag","my_tag_2"],
"locked": true
}
````
To delete/change tag via API the payload would look like:

````
{        "hostname": "newhostname.server.com",
          "description": "Server description",
          "tags": ["new_tag", "server"],
          "billing_cycle": "monthly",
          "locked": true,
      }

````
