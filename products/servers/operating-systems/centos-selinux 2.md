SELinux is incredibly valuable as part of an overall Linux system security strategy. To sucessfully provision CentOS on our platform, we have disabled SELinux as shown with the `sestatus` command.

````
[root@ewr1-t1 ~]# sestatus
SELinux status:                 disabled
````

Should your particular CentOS deployment require SELinux, you can easily enable it, as shown here:

````
yum install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted
````
Once policy is installed, you will want to simply create a file in the `/` called `.autorelabel`. To activate SELinux you must reboot the device.

````
shutdown -r now
````
Upon reaccessing the device, verify that SElinux is infact enable by running `sestatus` and you will see an output similar to the following:

````
[root@ewr1-t1 /]# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Max kernel policy version:      31
[root@ewr1-t1 /]#
````
> **_NOTE:_**  Should you need to reinstall the OS via our server reinstall feature, you MUST disable SELinux otherwise, the device will fail to reinstall.

To disable simply edit file ` /etc/selinux/config` change `enforcing` to `disabled` and reboot the device. Upon reaccessing the device, you can then proceed with the server reinstall feature.
