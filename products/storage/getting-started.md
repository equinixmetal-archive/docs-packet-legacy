While Packet offers a variety of storage options, including storage focused servers and object storage partnerships, some use cases require a more integrated solution. 

To support this, Packet works with an expanding group of partners (including Pure Storage and Datera) to provide a first-class experience. Packet works with storage partners to validate and integrate their products into our datacenters, API and operational support processes.  

Customers can bring their own appliance (e.g. purchase directly from a storage partner) or consolidate these into a single Packet invoice.
