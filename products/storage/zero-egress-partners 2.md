Packet partners with a number of providers to help users reduce traffic that flows over the public internet, which is both less ideal and expensive.  Current partners include:

* [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/) — We zero rate egress data charges to Wasabi's North American locations.
To support this, we regularly update the IP's associated with [Wasabi’s service domains](https://wasabi-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-regions-).

* [BackBlaze](https://backblaze.com) — We zero rate egress data charges to BackBlaze’s North American and Amsterdam locations. We also regularly update the [following Backblaze's IPs](https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/217664588-Backblaze-IP-Address-List?mobile_site=true).

If you have questions about how our egress partnerships will impact your billable usage, please reach out to support@packet.com for a conversation.
