All packet support channels are available from the [customer portal](https://app.packet.net/support). From there you can open a ticket, send us an email, open our community slack, @ us on twitter, or open a chat with our support engineers. You can also log into the [support portal](https://support.packet.com), where you can track the status of your open tickets.

**Tickets VS Chat** -- Most minor issues can be resolved over chat. However, it's best to submit a ticket if you encounter a problem with some faulty packet hardware, find a bug in a packet service, or have any other issue that might require long term investigation. Our support agents can do this for you if you discover you're problem is more extensive than it initially appeared while you are in chat.

Please be aware that we cannot make changes to an account that were requested over chat. That includes adjustments to entitlements, account reviews, hardware reservations, or IP allocations. These, and similar request, must be made via a ticket.

**Email** -- If you do not wish to log into the support portal, you are welcome to emailing support@packet.com. This will automatically open a ticket for you. Also, all replies to any of your open tickets will be emailed to you directly.

**Phone Calls** -- We don't operate a phone support service. This is because it's generally much easier for us to assist you when we have information written down that can easily be shared with other members of our support team, or our other engineers, if necessary. However, if you would like support while working through a complex issue we are available for schedules virtual meetings or calls.

**Slack** -- Our [community slack](https://slack.packet.com) is a good resource for support our agents may not be able to provide. This includes questions or problems regarding third party software and services. Packet's services are not managed, so any questions not related to Packet hardware or services would best be addressed to the community slack.

## Price & Billing

Pricing a physical server is really the sum of its parts - from switching and cables down to the actual chassis.  Of course, the most important cost is associated with the physical assets of the server - the processor, RAM, disks, etc.  

At Packet, we try to keep pricing simple, with clear hourly rates and discounts for committed \(monthly or annual\) usage. No multi-tenancy means that you get 100% access to all of the resources in a server - no sharing!  

While the price of these components from our suppliers vary substantially over time \(not to mention the wildly different cost of power and datacenter space throughout the world\) we do our best to smooth out the difference and keep prices stable.

### Discounts

Like most other companies, Packet offers aggressive discounts for term commitments.  While exact discounts vary by volume and other factors, average users can expect to save 20% or more.  

### What are billable items?

We value simplicity in pricing, so we offer all of our services by the hour.  This includes:

* Servers
* Block storage
* Elastic IP addresses
* Licensed software \(such as Windows Server 2012, RHEL7, SLES12 SP2\)

You can view the full pricing of our bare metal servers services [here](https://www.packet.com/bare-metal/), and you can view pricing and your current charges by logging into our control panel and viewing the devices in your projects.  

There is a billing tab in each of your projects which shows estimated total usage for the month. The reason it is estimated is that we don't apply custom rates or promo code discounts until an invoice is generated \(see below for more about that\).

### Additional Fees for Licensed Software

Packet enables users to deploy a growing list of commercial software solutions directly through the Packet portal or API.  These solutions do incur additional fees, which are often based on the socket \(e.g. physical CPU\) or allocated resources \(for instance GB's of storage\).

### What about bandwidth?

All Packet customers enjoy free inbound traffic and free traffic between servers in the same Packet project within the same datacenter location.

Outbound traffic to the Internet \(including to other Packet datacenter locations\) is charged at the **default rate of $0.05/GB**.   

Please contact [sales@packet.com](mailto:sales@packet.com) if you are interested in a larger bandwidth commitment \(10's of TBs\) to lower your per GB price.
