### Why we review Accounts

When signing up for a Packet account you may receive a notification informing you that your account has been flagged for manual review. Please note: this is in no way a judgment of your character, and the decision to flag an account is made by an algorithm, not a Packet employee.

Since we are an on demand hosting provider, our platform is often the target of payment fraud and other forms of abusive usage. Therefore, it is imperative that we properly vet all packet customers for possible fraud and abuse risk factors.

### What happens when my account is flagged?

When our system flags your account for manual review we automatically open a ticket for you regarding the account review. You can view this ticket in the [support portal](https://support.packet.com), or in your email inbox.

At this point you will be unable to interact with our customer portal until your account has been cleared by one of our support engineers.

### How do I clear my account?

When your account is marked for manual review we will reply to the ticket we opened for you. This may only be to inform you that the review process is complete, and that your account has been approved, but we often request that you provide some additional information to help us with the review.

If you're using Packet for business purposes, providing your Linkedin account will help us verify your identity and clear your account. Alternatively, if you do not used Linkedin, a link to an active Github account is helpful as well.

**note:** if you wish to use Packet for work associated with your company, use your company email on signup.

To help us understand confirm that you intend to operate within Packet's ToS, please describe your packet use case in as much detail as you are willing to share. Please be aware that some use cases are not allowed, while others are not *supported.* If your use case is not supported, we will still approve your account, and do our best to help you adjust your project requirements to fit the packet platform, should you choose to do so.
