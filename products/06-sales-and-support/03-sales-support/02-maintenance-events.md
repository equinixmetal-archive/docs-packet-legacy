# Scheduled maintenance
We do our best to ensure maximum uptime at Packet, but sometimes we still need
to perform maintenance operation on our server racks--or even entire
datacenters--to make upgrades or repairs to the network back bone, power
supply, or server hardware. Therefor, you may occasionally encounter scheduled
downtime. In such instances, minimizing the customer impact and helping you
prepare for the event and possible downtime is our first priority.

### Advanced Notice
Most Scheduled maintenance will be announced two weeks in advance in order to
allow our customers to prepare for the outage, if they are effected. However,
expedited maintenance events may only receive 3 days advanced notice. Given such
short notice, we would work to minimize the duration of any outage, and minimize
the impact to customers. If we must perform an emergency maintenance operation
all effected customers will receive an RFO after the event is completed, as you
may not receive prior warning of the maintenance event or related outages.

### Email Notifications
If we have determined that any packet services you are using will be impacted by
a scheduled maintenance event you will receive a notice by email of the event.
If your organization was assigned a Packet account representative then they may
contact you directly.

### Status Page
In addition to user emails, maintenance events will be announced on our
[status page](https://status.packet.com), where you can track the operation's
progress and subscribe for updates. If a maintenance event is not posted on the
status page, all effected users will be notified by email.
