While Packet does not offer a managed Kubernetes service, we do place a lot of emphasis on maintaining integrations with core parts of this fast-evolving ecosystem. We're also a strong supporter of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) including the [Community Infrastructure Lab](https://www.cncf.io/community/infrastructure-lab/).

In this section, you can find details about our CSI, CCM, Autoscaler and related investments.  In addition to our [Technical Guides](https://www.packet.com/resources/guides/), be sure to check out various Kubernetes examples and boilerplates on our [Packet Labs](https://github.com/packet-labs) GitHub repo.

We welcome any feedback!
