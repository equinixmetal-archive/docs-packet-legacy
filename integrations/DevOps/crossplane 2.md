Crossplane is an open source multicloud control plane which allows you to manage cloud-native applications and infrastructure across environments, clusters, regions and clouds.

Packet maintains an "[infra-stack](https://github.com/packethost/stack-packet)" for Crossplane which allows users to enable on-demand, cloud-portable provisioning of infrastructure services like databases, caches, and Kubernetes clusters.

[Details about Crossplane can be found here](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane).
